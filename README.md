# matplotlib-challenge

This was a cod ethat used csv files to run a report on mice that were being used for cancer treatment. Used many different graphs through Matplotlib to create graph that represent the data that was given. This was a a challenging one and I was not able to finish it the box plot to be exact but I think overall I learned how to use the the graphs efficently and got good experience with this exercise
